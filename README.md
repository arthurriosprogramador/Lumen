Lumen Expense Tracker is a simple Android app to help you track your expenses. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose as part of my CS50 final project.

### Description:
This app supports both offline and online usage, allowing users to register through a sign-up screen and log in through a sign-in screen.

It helps users track their financial transactions by allowing them to input and categorize expenses and incomes. All transactions can be viewed in a list with filters for date, category, and value range.

The home screen provides a summary of the userâ€™s financial activity, displaying the balance and grouping transactions by type (expenses or incomes) and by category (e.g., bills, credit card). It also features a chart that visually represents the distribution and percentage of each category, making it easier to understand financial patterns.

Additionally, the user can apply a time period filter that updates both the summary and the chart according to the selected period.
